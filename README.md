# Coach and Mentoring Management System.

A capstone project for that prototypes a centralised social network and marketplace for potential clients to find suitable coaches or mentors based on their needs. Users can request a mentorship based on ratings, mentoring fees and details mentioned on the mentorâ€™s profile. The mentors can then choose whether to accept based on the details and goals of the prospective mentee. Users of the platform will also be able to journal on the application to track their progress.
